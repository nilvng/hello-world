Hi there! I'm a Vietnamese Software Engineer based in Melbourne, Australia. 

I'm passionate about creating elegant and user-friendly mobile applications that make a difference in people's lives. With experience in both iOS and Android development, I enjoy tackling complex problems and turning innovative ideas into reality.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring Melbourne's vibrant brunch spots, especially hunting down speciality coffee places.

Feel free to check out my [projects](/projects/) or [get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like to collaborate!
