I have decided to own a corner of the internet. A place where I can share my thoughts about technology, life experiences.
I'm not sure what I will write about yet. But I'm sure it will be interesting.

How many times I had pushed off the idea of having my own website.
the burden of maintaining a website, the fear of not having anything interesting to say, or if I can write about anything.

It was just when the stars aligned. I was introduced to the world of open sources and knowing how important it is to be a part of this community.

If I can contribute to the Internet in any way, I would love to.
